# RPG Player

This is a tool inspired by DougDoug's AI powered RPG Videos:

Specifically it is trying to do something similar to his
[Multi-Agent-GPT-Characters
repository](https://github.com/DougDougGithub/Multi-Agent-GPT-Characters).

## Building

I have built this project using Python 3.13.5 and the
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) tool, although it should run with any Python
virtual environment.
